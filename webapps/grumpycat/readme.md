To run this make sure you install the dependencies first:

```bash
install-bx-module bx-ai --local
```

Add the `GEMINI_KEY` to your env

```bash
export GEMINI_KEY=your_gemini_key
```

Then run the following command to start the miniserver:

```bash
boxlang-miniserver
```

You can then access the miniserver at `http://localhost:8080` and start chatting with the AI Grumpy Cat.  Don't get scared if it talks to you!
